## Tasks  
**Objective:** 
- *understanding incapsulation;*
- *study design pattern Strategy.*

1. Implement an Newton algorithm for calculate the root of n-degree (n is natural) from the number a (a is real) with a given accuracy. Check the work of the method (compare the result with the value calculated using the .NET Framework class Math.Pow method).
2. Implement the "Bubble Sort" algorithm of integer array (do not usу methods of class System.Array) so that there was an opportunity to order matrix rows:
   - in order of increasing (decreasing) sums of elements of rows of the matrix; 
   - in order of increasing (decreasing) the maximum elements of rows of the matrix; 
   - in order of increasing (decreasing) the minimum elements of rows of the matrix; 
   - etc.
